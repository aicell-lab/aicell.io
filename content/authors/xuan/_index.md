Hello, Iâ€™m Xuan Liu! Iâ€™m currently a Masterâ€™s project student at AICell Lab, coming from the MTLS programâ€”a collaborative bioinformatics-focused initiative by KTH, KI, and SU.

Originally from China, I completed my undergraduate studies at Northwest A&F University, where I focused on molecular biology and microbiology. Driven by a curiosity for bioinformatics, I came to Stockholm to pursue my masterâ€™s degree. Throughout my studies, I developed a strong interest in machine learning, which has shaped my current project at AICell Lab. Here, Iâ€™m working on fine-tuning GPT-4 for bioimage-specific analysis, along with exploring advanced object detection model, with the goal of enhancing automation in biological research.

My work combines my passion for AI and biology, particularly in the realm of image analysis, and Iâ€™m excited to continue pushing the boundaries in this field.
