Hi! I'm Emma, a master's student diving into the fascinating world of AI at the AI Cell Lab. Armed with a bachelor's degree in Engineering Physics from KTH, I'm currently shaping my thesis around diffusion models for conditional cell image generation. I'm very excited to join the lab and apply my skills from maths, physics and data science to my favourite subject - life science.
