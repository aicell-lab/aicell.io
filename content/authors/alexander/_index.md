Hello, I'm Alexander. I'm born and raised in Stockholm, and studied Computer Science for my Bachelor's degree at KTH. For my bachelor's thesis, I did a study that compared state-of-the-art Deep Neural Networks and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees on tabular datasets.

Currently, I'm doing my Master's degree in Machine Learning at KTH as well. During my studies I've done a fair amount of personal projects, but most recently I did a software engineering internship at PayPal in Stockholm.

Outside of work, I love sports in general, and golf and hockey in particular. Both playing and watching!

I'm excited to work on machine learning research and infrastructure here at AICell lab, and I'm specifically excited to applying what I already know to biology, and learning lots more.
