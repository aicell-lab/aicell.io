Hi, I am Hanzhao. My academic journey began with a bachelor degree in biomedicine from Jilin University in China. After that I came to Uppsala University in Sweden for master study. I also finished her PhD in neurobiology and cancer biology in Uppsala University later. 

Although with years of wet lab experience, I become passionate about understanding dynamic cellular processes through advanced microscopy and computational approaches, which leads her to the research at AICell lab. 

As the biologist in the lab, I focus on establishing robust cell models for datasets in model training.
