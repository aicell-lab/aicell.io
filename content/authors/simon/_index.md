My name is Simon Britzelli. I was born and raised in the Stockholm area. I have a great fascination with the natural sciences, particularly medical technology. Specifically, I have a profound interest in areas of medical technology wherein machine learning is applicable. During my education at KTH, I have specialised in biology, physics, and, chiefly, programming, with a penchant for both theoretical and applied machine learning. 

I also have a keen interest in computers and computing-an interest I have had since childhood-and enjoy all things from building computers to their various uses. Moreover, I enjoy the process of learning, and have a multitude of interests that I pursue in my free time.
