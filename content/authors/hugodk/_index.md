Hello, Hugo here! I'm a newly graduated computer scientist from KTH, specialized in AI.

I was born and raised in Stockholm but love traveling and learning new languages, hopefully made obvious by my exchange to KAIST in South Korea in 2023 and my skills in Spanish and Mandarin.

My bachelor's comprised computer science courses covering most parts of the field, including a thesis in 3D graphics. Perhaps most importantly, my bachelors' is when I first got to try machine learning. This experience soon convinced me to focus on AI moving forward.

My master's featured a strong emphasis on AI, with courses ranging from natural language processing to predicting commuter traffic volume. During this time, I completed an internship and a master's thesis at Schibsted, developing their internal software tools and improving news article title generation using fine-tuned LLMs, respectively.

Now at AICell, I'm excited to help advance the development of AI in biological applications!
