Seeking to build upon its rich legacy, we undertook an ambitious endeavor: to transition ImageJ to the web through ImageJ.JS. The outcome? An unequivocal triumph. ImageJ.JS has captivated a global audience, attracting over 1,000 users daily. The ability to run ImageJ on mobile devices and iPads has been particularly celebrated, offering users a newfound flexibility and accessibility in their work.\nA Brief Look Back The creation of ImageJ.JS originated from a desire to bring the robust capabilities of the ImageJ image analysis tool directly to web browsers. In the initial stages, we utilized compilers such as CheerpJ to facilitate this transition. This process entailed converting Java Archive (.jar) files into JavaScript (.jar.js) files, thereby enabling the execution of Java applications in browsers without necessitating plugins.\nHowever, despite these efforts, we encountered several hurdles:\nFile Size Limitations: The web-based environment imposed constraints on loading large datasets, restricting us to files smaller than 4GB. Lack of Multi-threading Support: The absence of multi-threading capabilities limited the performance and speed of computations. Plugin Integration Challenges: Incorporating and compiling ImageJ plugins into the web version was a complex task, often requiring extensive adjustments to ensure compatibility. To address these issues, we initiated a fork of the ImageJ project on GitHub. Here, we explored solutions to bypass the aforementioned constraints and enhance functionality. By delving into the source code, we aimed to optimize ImageJ.JS for smoother and more efficient performance in web environments.\nElevating ImageJ.JS Determined to enhance ImageJ.JS, our team actively sought out cutting-edge solutions that could refine the user experience and expand its capabilities. Recently, the launch of the updated CheerpJ compiler 3 provided a promising avenue for exploration.\nThis new version of CheerpJ introduced several transformative features. Notably, the new JIT compilation support eliminated the necessity for an intermediate compilation step, which had previously been a cumbersome phase in the deployment process. Instead, the updated CheerpJ allows .jar files, originally constructed for a standard Java Virtual Machine (JVM), to be loaded directly into the browser. It also support full classloader which makes it easier to dynamically load jar files. This innovation significantly streamlined the process of bringing Java applications into web environments.\nSo, what implications does this have for ImageJ.JS?\nStreamlined Plugin Integration: The ability to load .jar files directly paves the way for easier integration with ImageJ’s vast plugin ecosystem. Users can now anticipate smoother, more straightforward implementations of plugins, enhancing the versatility of ImageJ.JS. Dynamic Patching Capabilities: The updated CheerpJ facilitates dynamic patching, wherein we can swiftly adapt and modify functions to align with web-specific requirements. This provides a seamless transition between traditional desktop applications and web environments, ensuring consistent user experience across platforms. Upon delving deep into the capabilities of the updated CheerpJ, we were encouraged by the initial results. Enhancements in the speed and efficiency of certain functions were evident, and the newfound ease of integration marked a significant step forward.\nHere is how the 3D volume viewer looks like in the new ImageJ.JS:\nAnd the 3D surface plot:\nWithout any compilation step, we can for example, directly load the MorpholibJ plugin and run it inside ImageJ.JS:\nFeel free to try the new version yourself at https://aicell-lab.github.io/imagej.js/.\nHowever, we recognize that this is an ongoing journey of optimization and exploration. Our team continues to probe the possibilities and potential improvements, committed to elevating ImageJ.JS to its utmost potential.\nThe Future of ImageJ.JS ImageJ.JS’s popularity isn’t just in numbers. Its adaptability on platforms like mobiles and iPads has won users’ hearts. With this enthusiasm, we are even more committed to refining the experience.\nNext steps include:\nFix the file loading with the hope of support files larger than the memory Evaluating file chooser integration and potential mapping with our elFinder plugin. Envisioning a browser version of Fiji with a robust plugin system, enabling most ImageJ plugins to be used directly in ImageJ.JS. In wrapping up, ImageJ.JS represents the convergence of a powerful legacy tool with modern technological adaptability. As we push its boundaries, we’re excited about its potential to further transform scientific image analysis on the web.\nJoin Us on This Journey We invite you to participate in this exciting venture.

This event, organized by Wei Ouyang at KTH Sweden, partner of the AI4Life, with generous support from Global BioImaging, took place from June 5th to 9th, 2023, at the distinguished SciLifeLab in Stockholm, Sweden.\nThe objective of this hackathon was to bring together thought leaders from various backgrounds to discuss and design advanced web/cloud infrastructure for bioimage analysis, using the latest AI tools. This fusion of technology and biology aimed to drive future advancements in the life sciences and computing arenas.\nFrom everywhere to the SciLifeLab We welcomed a myriad of participants from around the globe, representing prestigious institutions and industrial partners from both the EU and the US. The renowned platforms present at the event, such as the BioImage Model Zoo (BMZ), Fiji, ITK, Apeer, Knime, ImJoy, Piximi, Icy, and deepImageJ, each demonstrated their unique contributions to the evolving field of bioimage analysis.\nPresentations and demos! The kick-off of the hackathon featured a series of introductions and presentations. Wei Ouyang, the leader of the newly founded AICell Lab, presented a compelling overview of his team’s work, including the development of Hypha and BioEngine which serves as a robust platform for running AI models in the cloud and a large language model-based tool for code generation in image analysis.\nNext up, the Piximi team impressed the attendees with their demonstration of how AI models can be run in a web browser using JavaScript, showcasing a powerful annotation tool for bioimage analysis. Not to be outdone, the APEER platform revealed its latest feature for training AI models and subsequent local downloads for inference.\nThe “talkathon” Initially, the hackathon resembled a “talkathon”, with participants passionately engaging in dynamic discussions, creating synergy and forming interest groups. These conversations traversed a broad spectrum of topics, ranging from enhancing the usability of client tools, supporting custom pre/postprocessing (like StarDist or Cellpose), and even complex inference modes such as test-time augmentation. The consensus was achieved by proposing an ‘ops’ registry — a GitHub repository that stores dependencies and entry point codes for running custom bioimage analysis operations. In essence, this would create a library of operations that could be linked to each model in the BMZ, with each model potentially having multiple operations.\nHands-on As the hackathon progressed, it shifted focus towards practical collaboration. Participants dove into hands-on activities, such as linking tools like Piximi and Knime to BioEngine, developing guidelines for assigning task-specific tags, and exploring remote rendering capabilities with AGAVE and itk-vtk-viewer, among other tasks.\nConclusions While the hackathon itself has concluded, the collaborations it sparked continue. Participants are building on the progress made during the event, marking the beginning of what we anticipate to be a series of exciting advancements in the field. We firmly believe that this event will catalyze further progress in the bioimaging and AI communities and eagerly\n","date":1687478400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687478400,"objectID":"f31cbb8c92d89e19c1440e0fd056dc1e","permalink":"https://aicell.io/post/web-cloud-hackathon-stockholm-2023/","publishdate":"2023-06-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/web-cloud-hackathon-stockholm-2023/","section":"post","summary":"The AICell Lab is hosting a AI4Life Hackathon on Web and Cloud Infrastructure for AI-Powered BioImage Analysis took place at SciLifeLab from June 5th to 9th, 2023, showcasing the vibrant nature of our field.","tags":["bioengine","hackathon"],"title":"Hosting Hackathon on Web \u0026 Cloud for AI-powered BioImage Analysis","type":"post"},{"authors":["Wei Ouyang"],"categories":["recruitment"],"content":"Title: Postdoc in Cell Biology and Microscopy Imaging\nApplication Closed (Deadline: August 24th, 2023)\nJob description The AICell Lab (https://aicell.io) in the department of Applied Physics at KTH and Science for Life Laboratory is a new research group funded by the Data-driven Life Science Fellows program.

Get to know our latest fellow, Wei Ouyang (KTH), in our Q\u0026amp;A-style article series. Wei will join the Cell and molecular biology research area.\nWei began his academic journey in engineering sciences in China before moving to Paris to pursue his PhD in 2014. There, he focused on AI and advanced microscopy imaging. In 2019, he joined Emma Lundberg’s group at SciLifeLab \u0026amp; KTH as a postdoctoral researcher for four years. Before joining DDLS, Wei had the opportunity to spend some months at Stanford University as a visiting scholar.\nPassionate about developing AI-based computational methods and open-source platforms to democratize AI in life science, Wei is actively involved in consortiums and community activities that promote open, scalable, accessible, and reproducible data-driven life science.\nHe is now thrilled to establish the AICell Lab at SciLifeLab, which focuses on building AI-systems for cell and molecular biology. The lab’s ambition is to create a large-scale human cell simulator powered by massive AI models and automated microscopy imaging farms.\nHow do you think your expertise can contribute to the program?\nGiven the current advancements in AI, particularly the significant progress in generative modelling like chatGPT and Diffusion models, I see enormous potential for applying these foundational models to data-driven life sciences in a fully data-driven manner. Translating the successes from natural language processing and computer vision to life sciences requires a deep understanding of the methods, as well as highly interdisciplinary expertise in AI, data science, and biology, among other areas. It demands not only innovation in data analysis but also in data generation. My experience in robotic systems, AI-powered advanced microscopy, image and multi-omics data analysis, data-driven whole-cell modelling, open-source AI tool development, and online data sharing and AI model serving platforms makes me well-suited to contribute to these efforts.\nIn addition to my technical expertise, I strongly believe in the importance of open-source software development and community engagement in scientific research. I have been actively involved in creating and sharing tools that make deep learning more accessible to researchers, as well as promoting open and reproducible scientific tools. My experience in community building and leadership will be invaluable in driving and reforming the data-driven life science program, fostering collaboration, and accelerating progress in this exciting and rapidly evolving field.\nShortly describe your research in an easy to understand way.\nMy research focuses on creating a “black-box” human cell simulator using powerful AI models. This ambitious project involves developing autonomous systems to collect massive amounts of high-quality data for AI training, including building a fully automated imaging farm. By running AI models in real-time, we create a self-driving imaging and cell experimentation system, which allows us to optimize experimental conditions and capture rare cellular events.\nUltimately, our goal is to develop a human cell simulator that unlocks the potential for in-silico cell experimentation, drug discovery, and fosters a holistic understanding of human cells.\nHow do you think the program and interactions with the other DDLS-Fellows will benefit you?\nThe DDLS program is a visionary investment in the next generation of life science and offers a fantastic starting package to build a community that pioneers the future of the field. Being a part of this program has given me the incredible opportunity to establish my own research group.\nInteracting with other DDLS-Fellows allows us to help each other, learn, and grow together. The program also serves as a platform for expanding my network of collaborations and learning new skills from experts both within and outside the program. I believe that, in the future, we will see even more coordinated efforts to shape data-driven life sciences through these valuable connections.\nName one thing that people generally do not know about you.\nThroughout my studies, I developed a fascination for computational philosophy and the view of the universe as a giant computer. The concept of emergent behaviour from the iterative evaluation of simple rules, similar to how cells in biology and large language models in AI function, particularly intrigued me. This has inspired my passion for developing a human cell simulator, as it presents a unique and exciting opportunity to delve into the underlying rules governing cellular behaviour.\nWhere do you see yourself in five years regarding the DDLS aspect?\nIn five years, I envision myself having established a robust framework for data-driven whole-cell simulation, contributing …","date":1683676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683676800,"objectID":"45e677899a29a627b88cee14464e9742","permalink":"https://aicell.io/post/ddls-fellow-wei-ouyang/","publishdate":"2023-05-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/ddls-fellow-wei-ouyang/","section":"post","summary":"Wei Ouyang joined SciLifeLab as a DDLS fellow on Jan 1st. 2023, specializes in AI-based computational methods and will establish the AICell Lab for building AI systems in cell and molecular biology.","tags":["SciLifeLab","DDLS","AI"],"title":"New DDLS Fellow: Wei Ouyang","type":"post"},{"authors":["Wei Ouyang"],"categories":["news"],"content":"Wei Ouyang Receives Göran Gustafsson Prize in Applied Physics Originally Posted on gustafssonsstiftelser website (in Swedish), on 9th May 2023\nWei Ouyang receives the Göran Gustafsson prize in Applied Physics at KTH.

It enables us to build next generation software that are powerful, flexible, but with only very simple speech or text prompt interface.\nIt can completely change how software tools are delivered to the users. Since the codex model can read developer document and generate code based on the documentation, developers can focus on making reusable library and forget about the GUI part. For each bioimage anlysis task, we can provide a prompt (a chunk of text with hint on how to perform a certain task) and user can then use English or other natural language to send instruction to perform the analysis task. During the code generation, reusable UI components such as jupyter widgets, imjoy plugins or napari can be used to provide rich interaction.\nThe key difference compared to conventional software design is that the code are generated on the fly, and it effectively makes the user (without programming skills) a developer and makes the software more generalizable for more applications. In addition, the generated software can be reused and published, for example, one can easily generate napari or ImJoy plugins with codex model.\nHowever, as of now, the Codex model remains a black box and we do not have an actual way of controlling the code generation process besides the prompt and instructions. As a result, the generated code are not always correct and safe to run on the user’s computer (e.g. it might accidentally remove all the data). Therefore, it is safer to run it in a sandbox environment, e.g. in the browser or docker containers.\nOn the other hand, ImJoy is ideally suited for working with AI generated code because every ImJoy plugin runs in its own sandbox environment and it is easy enough to contain AI generate code that might go wrong seriously. Within the #ImJoy team, we are currently developing a new interface based on Codex code generation.

We are Sweden’s largest technical research and learning institution and home to students, researchers and faculty from around the world. Our research and education covers a wide area including natural sciences and all branches of engineering, as well as architecture, industrial management, urban planning, history and philosophy.\nProject description Third-cycle subject: Biological Physics\nThe Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab) is a national center for molecular biosciences with focus on health and environmental research. The combination of the highly interdisciplinary expertise and research projects at the department is unique in Sweden and also at an international level. This expertise ranges across cell biology, biochemistry, biophysics and theory. Recently, the SciLifeLab and Wallenberg National Program started the Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS) program in order to accelerate life science research through innovations in AI and data science.\nThe AICell Lab (https://aicell.io) in the department of Applied Physics at KTH and SciLifeLab is a new research group funded by the DDLS Fellows program. The group, led by Wei Ouyang, focuses on building AI systems for data-driven cell and molecular biology. To expand the team, we are now opening a position for a doctoral student in biological physics with a focus on cell biology, automation and AI-augmented microscopy imaging.\nWhole-cell modeling enables a holistic and quantitative view of cell biology and allows performing in-silico experimentation which has a great potential in revolutionizing system biology, synthetic biology, medicine and other applications in life science. However, modeling the entire cell is an extremely complex task and is heavily limited by our understanding of the biological systems. As a newly formed research group, we would like to take the grand challenge of modeling the human cell through recent advances in artificial intelligence and multi-omics data generation. To enable large-scale AI and data-driven whole cell modeling, we are currently building a smart microscopy imaging farm to ramp up the production rate of image data. The imaging farm consists of multiple microscopes and fluidic systems, robotic arms, liquid handling robots and automatic incubators. The farm will be used for performing automated brightfield/fluorescence imaging, long-term live cell imaging, tracking, spatial-omics and multiplexing imaging. For the whole-cell modeling project, we aim to build an AI-powered automated imaging system to actively detect, monitor and track the live human cells under drug and genetic perturbations. We would like to develop AI models which read changes in cell morphology and fluorescence markers, to generate control signals for driving the microscope, capture rare events and create balanced dataset for modeling.\nYou will be responsible for actively and effectively designing and implementing wet lab experiments in the imaging farm, including cell culture, sample preparation and microscopy imaging. Importantly, you will also actively work with other researchers in the group to develop and adapt protocols for the automated imaging farm and AI models. Besides wet lab skills, you will elaborate on your computational skills, e.g., by writing Python scripts to control the imaging farm, train AI models and develop automated data analysis workflows. In later stages of the project you will also design and conduct additional, custom validation experiments, which may involve different molecular biology techniques.\nSupervision: Professor Hjalmar Brismar and Assistant Professor Wei Ouyang are proposed to supervise the doctoral student.

It enables us to build next generation software that are powerful, flexible, but with only very simple speech or text prompt interface.\nIt can completely change how software tools are delivered to the users. Since the codex model can read developer document and generate code based on the documentation, developers can focus on making reusable library and forget about the GUI part. For each bioimage anlysis task, we can provide a prompt (a chunk of text with hint on how to perform a certain task) and user can then use English or other natural language to send instruction to perform the analysis task. During the code generation, reusable UI components such as jupyter widgets, ImJoy plugins or napari can be used to provide rich interaction.\nThe key difference compared to conventional software design is that the code are generated on the fly, and it effectively makes the user (without programming skills) a developer and makes the software more generalizable for more applications. In addition, the generated software can be reused and published, for example, one can easily generate napari or ImJoy plugins with codex model.\nHowever, as of now, the Codex model remains a black box and we do not have an actual way of controlling the code generation process besides the prompt and instructions. As a result, the generated code are not always correct and safe to run on the user’s computer (e.g. it might accidentally remove all the data). Therefore, it is safer to run it in a sandbox environment, e.g. in the browser or docker containers.\nOn the other hand, ImJoy is ideally suited for working with AI generated code because every ImJoy plugin runs in its own sandbox environment and it is easy enough to contain AI generate code that might go wrong seriously. Within the #ImJoy team, we are currently developing a new interface based on Codex code generation. The new interface will be accessible from a web browser and connected to a cloud infrastructure that allows multi-model serving, data management and serverless app hosting.\nIn the AICell Lab, we developed the Codex Chat Notebook which aims to use OpenAI Codex to generate python code for image analysis and beyond. The project is currented hosted at: https://github.com/oeway/codex-chat-notebook.\nIf you have an OpenAI api token (get it from here), you can already try it out with our Jupyter notebook running in the browser: https://jupyter.imjoy.io/lab/index.html ","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"de84935dc40c6e3822e055ceaffeccd5","permalink":"https://aicell.io/project/codex-chat-notebook/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/codex-chat-notebook/","section":"project","summary":"AI-assisted BioImage Analysis with OpenAI CODEX","tags":["deep learning","AI","software","microscopy","bioimaging"],"title":"Codex Chat Notebook","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Whole-cell modeling enables a holistic and quantitative view of cell biology and allows performing in-silico experimentation which has a great potential in revolutionizing system biology, synthetic biology, medicine and other applications in life science.

Combined with increasing data repositories in genomics, imaging and other fields, such successes underlay a growing demand to adapt DL methods to new datasets and questions1. However, the dissemination of DL approaches faces considerable hurdles. Most published DL studies2,3,4,5 require users to retrain models on their own data to obtain the best performance and/or avoid erroneous results. Although trained models are frequently available through web applications or ImageJ plugins, retraining is typically only possible via scripts or command lines, rather than graphical user interfaces (GUIs). In addition, the complexities of setting up the required hardware and software environments often constitute forbidding obstacles6. Furthermore, the large datasets and computational resources typical of current DL successes pose challenges to traditional desktop-oriented software that tightly couple GUI and computation. Cloud services can partly alleviate these difficulties, but raise privacy and confidentiality issues that can be prohibitive for medical data7. Meanwhile, deploying scientific software to mobile platforms can make them accessible to billions of people8, enabling large-scale biomedical research and citizen science. These opportunities and challenges call for new computational frameworks.\nFor more information, read our publication on Nature Methods.\nLive Demos This website contains ImJoy integration, you can find some example applications for image visualization below:\nKaibu Run Kaibu\nITK/VTK Viewer To visualize an image with ITK/VTK viewer, click here\nVizarr Example Vizarr be embedded in the page directly:\nYou can also view the image in a dialog by clicking here ","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"e30216927b8db55fcce4fc9258591e31","permalink":"https://aicell.io/project/imjoy/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/imjoy/","section":"project","summary":"A computational platform for supercharging scalability and interactivity","tags":["deep learning","AI","web image analysis","web browser","webassembly"],"title":"ImJoy - Web Data Analysis","type":"project"},{"authors":["Carlos Garcia Lopez de Haro","Stephane Dallongeville","Thomas Musset","Estibaliz Gomez de Mariscal","Daniel Sage","Wei Ouyang","Arrate Munoz-Barrutia","Jean-Yves Tinevez","Jean-Christophe Olivo-Marin"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688586674,"objectID":"5b4015b65535cd1d764d59e65e54c30e","permalink":"https://aicell.io/publication/de-2023-jdll/","publishdate":"2023-11-06T17:16:29.081817Z","relpermalink":"/publication/de-2023-jdll/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"JDLL: A library to run Deep Learning models on Java bioimage informatics platforms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wei Ouyang","Kevin W Eliceiri","Beth A Cimini"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1699290990,"objectID":"0ba59db27cf7758ef190a87f1046b4a6","permalink":"https://aicell.io/publication/ouyang-2023-moving/","publishdate":"2023-11-06T17:16:30.018706Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ouyang-2023-moving/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Moving beyond the desktop: prospects for practical bioimage analysis via the web","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Josh Moore","Daniela Basurto-Lozada","Sébastien Besson","John Bogovic","Jordão Bragantini","Eva M Brown","Jean-Marie Burel","Xavier Casas Moreno","Gustavo de Medeiros","Erin E Diel"," others"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688586673,"objectID":"ba75e9e4bfdfcfcd4a2aac1f8b17c86b","permalink":"https://aicell.io/publication/moore-2023-ome/","publishdate":"2023-11-06T17:16:28.159481Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moore-2023-ome/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"OME-Zarr: a cloud-optimized bioimaging file format with international community support","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The aim of the project is to build a smart microscopy imaging farm for massive production of image data.
