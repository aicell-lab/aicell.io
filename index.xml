&lt;p>Recently, our community had the opportunity to partake in a dynamic event that demonstrated the vibrant nature of our field: The &lt;a href="https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI4Life&lt;/a> Hackathon on Web and Cloud Infrastructure for AI-Powered BioImage Analysis. This event, organized by Wei Ouyang at KTH Sweden, partner of the AI4Life, with generous support from Global BioImaging, took place from June 5th to 9th, 2023, at the distinguished SciLifeLab in Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The objective of this hackathon was to bring together thought leaders from various backgrounds to discuss and design advanced web/cloud infrastructure for bioimage analysis, using the latest AI tools. This fusion of technology and biology aimed to drive future advancements in the life sciences and computing arenas.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="from-everywhere-to-the-scilifelab">From everywhere to the SciLifeLab&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We welcomed a myriad of participants from around the globe, representing prestigious institutions and industrial partners from both the EU and the US. The renowned platforms present at the event, such as the BioImage Model Zoo (BMZ), Fiji, ITK, Apeer, Knime, ImJoy, Piximi, Icy, and deepImageJ, each demonstrated their unique contributions to the evolving field of bioimage analysis.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="presentations-and-demos">Presentations and demos!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The kick-off of the hackathon featured a series of introductions and presentations. Wei Ouyang, the leader of the newly founded AICell Lab, presented a compelling overview of his team’s work, including the development of &lt;a href="https://github.com/amun-ai/hypha" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hypha&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://aicell.io/project/bioengine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioEngine&lt;/a> which serves as a robust platform for running AI models in the cloud and &lt;a href="https://forum.image.sc/t/ai-assisted-bioimage-analysis-with-openai-codex/62045" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a large language model-based tool for code generation in image analysis&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next up, the &lt;a href="https://www.piximi.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Piximi&lt;/a> team impressed the attendees with their demonstration of how AI models can be run in a web browser using JavaScript, showcasing a powerful annotation tool for bioimage analysis. Not to be outdone, the &lt;a href="https://www.apeer.com/app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">APEER&lt;/a> platform revealed its latest feature for training AI models and subsequent local downloads for inference.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-talkathon">The “talkathon”&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Initially, the hackathon resembled a “talkathon”, with participants passionately engaging in dynamic discussions, creating synergy and forming interest groups. These conversations traversed a broad spectrum of topics, ranging from enhancing the usability of client tools, supporting custom pre/postprocessing (like StarDist or Cellpose), and even complex inference modes such as test-time augmentation. The consensus was achieved by proposing an ‘ops’ registry — a GitHub repository that stores dependencies and entry point codes for running custom bioimage analysis operations. In essence, this would create a library of operations that could be linked to each model in the BMZ, with each model potentially having multiple operations.&lt;/p>

The group, led by Wei Ouyang, focuses on building AI systems for data-driven cell and molecular biology. To expand the team, we are now opening a position for a postdoctoral researcher in cell biology and computational microscopy imaging. The aim is to develop wet lab protocols and analysis workflows for an AI-powered automated imaging system to actively detect, monitor and track the live human cells under drug and genetic perturbations. The project is supported by the WASP DDLS collaboration, and in close collaboration with the Jaldén group at KTH and the Lundberg group under the Human Protein Atlas, which is a unique world-leading effort to map all the human proteins in cells, tissues, and organs in the human body.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will be responsible for actively and effectively designing, implementing, and optimizing wet lab experiments for the self-driving microscope, including cell culture, sample preparation and microscopy imaging. Importantly, you will also actively work with other researchers in the group to develop and optimize protocols for the automated imaging system and AI models. Besides wet lab skills, you will get the opportunity to elaborate on your computational skills, e.g., by writing Python scripts to control the imaging farm, train AI models and develop automated data analysis workflows. In later stages of the project you will also design and conduct additional, custom validation experiments, which may involve different molecular biology techniques.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>Originally Posted on &lt;a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/news/new-ddls-fellow-wei-ouyang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciLifeLab website&lt;/a>, on 10th May 2023&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>During 2023, the SciLifeLab &amp;amp; Wallenberg National Program for Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS) continued the recruitment of new fellows. Get to know our latest fellow, Wei Ouyang (KTH), in our Q&amp;amp;A-style article series. Wei will join the Cell and molecular biology research area.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wei began his academic journey in engineering sciences in China before moving to Paris to pursue his PhD in 2014. There, he focused on AI and advanced microscopy imaging. In 2019, he joined Emma Lundberg’s group at SciLifeLab &amp;amp; KTH as a postdoctoral researcher for four years. Before joining DDLS, Wei had the opportunity to spend some months at Stanford University as a visiting scholar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Passionate about developing AI-based computational methods and open-source platforms to democratize AI in life science, Wei is actively involved in consortiums and community activities that promote open, scalable, accessible, and reproducible data-driven life science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He is now thrilled to establish the &lt;a href="https://aicell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AICell Lab&lt;/a> at SciLifeLab, which focuses on building AI-systems for cell and molecular biology. The lab’s ambition is to create a large-scale human cell simulator powered by massive AI models and automated microscopy imaging farms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How do you think your expertise can contribute to the program?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given the current advancements in AI, particularly the significant progress in generative modelling like chatGPT and Diffusion models, I see enormous potential for applying these foundational models to data-driven life sciences in a fully data-driven manner. Translating the successes from natural language processing and computer vision to life sciences requires a deep understanding of the methods, as well as highly interdisciplinary expertise in AI, data science, and biology, among other areas. It demands not only innovation in data analysis but also in data generation. My experience in robotic systems, AI-powered advanced microscopy, image and multi-omics data analysis, data-driven whole-cell modelling, open-source AI tool development, and online data sharing and AI model serving platforms makes me well-suited to contribute to these efforts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to my technical expertise, I strongly believe in the importance of open-source software development and community engagement in scientific research. I have been actively involved in creating and sharing tools that make deep learning more accessible to researchers, as well as promoting open and reproducible scientific tools. My experience in community building and leadership will be invaluable in driving and reforming the data-driven life science program, fostering collaboration, and accelerating progress in this exciting and rapidly evolving field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Shortly describe your research in an easy to understand way.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My research focuses on creating a “black-box” human cell simulator using powerful AI models. This ambitious project involves developing autonomous systems to collect massive amounts of high-quality data for AI training, including building a fully automated imaging farm. By running AI models in real-time, we create a self-driving imaging and cell experimentation system, which allows us to optimize experimental conditions and capture rare cellular events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, our goal is to develop a human cell simulator that unlocks the potential for in-silico cell experimentation, drug discovery, and fosters a holistic understanding of human cells.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How do you think the program and interactions with the other DDLS-Fellows will benefit you?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The DDLS program is a visionary investment in the next generation of life science and offers a fantastic starting package to build a community that pioneers the future of the field. Being a part of this program has given me the incredible opportunity to establish my own research group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interacting with other DDLS-Fellows allows us to help each other, learn, and grow together. The program also serves as a platform for expanding my network of collaborations and learning new skills from experts both within and outside the program. I believe that, in the future, we will see even more coordinated efforts to shape data-driven life sciences through these valuable connections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Name one thing that people generally do not know about you.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Throughout my studies, I developed a fascination for computational philosophy and the view of the universe as a giant computer. The concept of emergent behaviour from the iterative evaluation of simple rules, similar to how cells in biology and large language models in AI function, particularly intrigued me.

&lt;p>&lt;em>Originally Posted on &lt;a href="https://gustafssonsstiftelser.se/wei-ouyang-teknisk-fysik-kth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gustafssonsstiftelser website (in Swedish)&lt;/a>, on 9th May 2023&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wei Ouyang receives the Göran Gustafsson prize in Applied Physics at KTH. The prize provides Wei a worth &lt;strong>3 million SEK&lt;/strong>, spread over three years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wei grew up in southern China and received his doctorate in 2018 at the Institut Pasteur, Paris, France. After his PhD, Wei spent four years as a postdoctoral researcher at SciLifeLab and KTH.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Wei Ouyang describes his research as follows&lt;/strong>: My work is focused on building artificial intelligence systems for cell and molecular biology. My interdisciplinary group, AICell Lab, focuses on creating data-driven whole-cell models with the ambitious goal of constructing a human cell simulator. To achieve this, Wei and his team are working on innovations in data analysis, modeling and generation with an emphasis on the importance of autonomous systems for the collection of huge amounts of high-quality data suitable for training AI models.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wei further says that his group is developing a fully automated imaging system, equipped with multiple microscopes, robotic arms, liquid handling robots and automated incubators. He highlights that AI models run in real-time to augment microscope views with artificial labels and annotations, enabling feedback signals to control cell growth, differentiation, and to adjust microscope settings to optimize phototoxicity and capture rare events in living cells.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The long-term goal of Wei&amp;rsquo;s research is to create large-scale whole human cell models by combining existing multi-omics datasets with new data generated by the imaging system. He envisions these human cell models as having great potential in cell experimentation in silicon, drug discovery, and contributing to a holistic and systematic understanding of the human cell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Outside the laboratory, Wei says he enjoys exploring the Stockholm archipelago and snowboarding in the winter.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Research Engineer for AI-driven Web and Cloud Software Development</title><link>https://aicell.io/recruiting/engineer-1-ai4life/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aicell.io/recruiting/engineer-1-ai4life/</guid><description>&lt;p>Title: Research Engineer for AI-driven Web and Cloud Software Development&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>Originally Posted on &lt;a href="https://forum.image.sc/t/ai-assisted-bioimage-analysis-with-openai-codex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image.sc&lt;/a>, on 17th Jan 2022&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Deep learning has already revolutionized the way we do image analysis, now it comes the latest AI models for natural language processing which will change the way we interact with bioimage analysis software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is an Open AI codex demo showing how one can generate Python code from English for bioimage analysis including cellpose segmentation, feature extraction and plotting!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Watch the video here:&lt;/p>
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pkOp_oUybsc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen>&lt;/iframe>
&lt;p>This type of code generation technology is ideally suited for users without programming skills, and provides a solution for building simple interface for complex scientific software. It enables us to build next generation software that are powerful, flexible, but with only very simple speech or text prompt interface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It can completely change how software tools are delivered to the users. Since the codex model can read developer document and generate code based on the documentation, developers can focus on making reusable library and forget about the GUI part. For each bioimage anlysis task, we can provide a prompt (a chunk of text with hint on how to perform a certain task) and user can then use English or other natural language to send instruction to perform the analysis task. During the code generation, reusable UI components such as jupyter widgets, imjoy plugins or napari can be used to provide rich interaction.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key difference compared to conventional software design is that the code are generated on the fly, and it effectively makes the user (without programming skills) a developer and makes the software more generalizable for more applications. In addition, the generated software can be reused and published, for example, one can easily generate napari or ImJoy plugins with codex model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, as of now, the Codex model remains a black box and we do not have an actual way of controlling the code generation process besides the prompt and instructions. As a result, the generated code are not always correct and safe to run on the user&amp;rsquo;s computer (e.g. it might accidentally remove all the data). Therefore, it is safer to run it in a sandbox environment, e.g. in the browser or docker containers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, ImJoy is ideally suited for working with AI generated code because every ImJoy plugin runs in its own sandbox environment and it is easy enough to contain AI generate code that might go wrong seriously. Within the #ImJoy team, we are currently developing a new interface based on Codex code generation. The new interface will be accessible from a web browser and connected to a cloud infrastructure that allows multi-model serving, data management and serverless app hosting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, we are happy to hear your thoughts about this new direction!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Doctoral Student in Cell Biology and Computational Microscopy Imaging</title><link>https://aicell.io/recruiting/phd-1-wasp-ddls-biology/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aicell.io/recruiting/phd-1-wasp-ddls-biology/</guid><description>&lt;p>Title: Doctoral Student in Cell Biology and Computational Microscopy Imaging&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Application Closed (Deadline: 20.Feb.2023)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm has grown to become one of Europe&amp;rsquo;s leading technical and engineering universities, as well as a key centre of intellectual talent and innovation. We are Sweden&amp;rsquo;s largest technical research and learning institution and home to students, researchers and faculty from around the world. Our research and education covers a wide area including natural sciences and all branches of engineering, as well as architecture, industrial management, urban planning, history and philosophy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="project-description">Project description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Third-cycle subject: Biological Physics&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab) is a national center for molecular biosciences with focus on health and environmental research. The combination of the highly interdisciplinary expertise and research projects at the department is unique in Sweden and also at an international level. This expertise ranges across cell biology, biochemistry, biophysics and theory. Recently, the SciLifeLab and Wallenberg National Program started the &lt;a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS) program&lt;/a> in order to accelerate life science research through innovations in AI and data science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The AICell Lab (&lt;a href="https://aicell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://aicell.io&lt;/a>) in the department of Applied Physics at KTH and SciLifeLab is a new research group funded by the DDLS Fellows program. The group, led by Wei Ouyang, focuses on building AI systems for data-driven cell and molecular biology. To expand the team, we are now opening a position for a doctoral student in biological physics with a focus on cell biology, automation and AI-augmented microscopy imaging.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whole-cell modeling enables a holistic and quantitative view of cell biology and allows performing in-silico experimentation which has a great potential in revolutionizing system biology, synthetic biology, medicine and other applications in life science. However, modeling the entire cell is an extremely complex task and is heavily limited by our understanding of the biological systems. As a newly formed research group, we would like to take the grand challenge of modeling the human cell through recent advances in artificial intelligence and multi-omics data generation. To enable large-scale AI and data-driven whole cell modeling, we are currently building a smart microscopy imaging farm to ramp up the production rate of image data. The imaging farm consists of multiple microscopes and fluidic systems, robotic arms, liquid handling robots and automatic incubators. The farm will be used for performing automated brightfield/fluorescence imaging, long-term live cell imaging, tracking,  spatial-omics and multiplexing imaging. For the whole-cell modeling project, we aim to build an AI-powered automated imaging system to actively detect, monitor and track the live human cells under drug and genetic perturbations. We would like to develop AI models which read changes in cell morphology and fluorescence markers, to generate control signals for driving the microscope, capture rare events and create balanced dataset for modeling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will be responsible for actively and effectively designing and implementing wet lab experiments in the imaging farm, including cell culture, sample preparation and microscopy imaging. Importantly, you will also actively work with other researchers in the group to develop and adapt protocols for the automated imaging farm and AI models. Besides wet lab skills, you will elaborate on your computational skills, e.g., by writing Python scripts to control the imaging farm, train AI models and develop automated data analysis workflows. In later stages of the project you will also design and conduct additional, custom validation experiments, which may involve different molecular biology techniques.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Supervision: Professor Hjalmar Brismar and Assistant Professor Wei Ouyang are proposed to supervise the doctoral student. Decisions are made on admission.&lt;/p>

Our aim is to use recent deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks, transformers, AlphaFold and diffusion models to analysis existing multi-omics dataset, combining them with massive amount of newly generated live cell, multiplexed images, to model cellular behavior through generative and predictive models.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The candidates are expected to 1) develop machine learning models and tools for smart microscopy and image analysis 2) integrate multi-omics dataset 3) perform generative modeling and 4) create large-scale differentiable models to do spatial cell simulations. The project will be carried out on top of existing work and collaborate closely with PhDs and postdocs in the group.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab) is a national center for molecular biosciences with focus on health and environmental research. The combination of the highly interdisciplinary expertise and research projects at the department is unique in Sweden and also at an international level. This expertise ranges across cell biology, biochemistry, biophysics and theory. Recently, the SciLifeLab and Wallenberg National Program started the &lt;a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS) program&lt;/a> in order to accelerate life science research through innovations in AI and data science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The AICell Lab (&lt;a href="https://aicell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://aicell.io&lt;/a>) in the department of Applied Physics at KTH and SciLifeLab is a new research group funded by the DDLS Fellows program. The group, led by Wei Ouyang, focuses on building AI systems for data-driven cell and molecular biology. To expand the team, we are now looking for highly motivated candidates to fill a 2-year postdoc position under the &lt;a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven/wasp-collaboration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WASP-DDLS collaboration&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The aim of the project is to develop an AI-powered self-driving microscopy system for studying cellular response under genetic and environmental stressors. The project will also be supported by the WASP-DDLS collaboration, and closely collaborate with the Jaldén group at KTH. The Jaldén group has rich experience in computer vision and automatic control systems. The work will also be supported by the Lundberg group under the Human Protein Atlas, which is a unique world-leading effort to map all the human proteins in cells, tissues, and organs in the human body. By joining the force with the Jaldén group and Lundberg group, we would like to develop an AI-powered imaging system to continuously monitor, actively acquire and track human cells under different cellular and environmental stressors. The data will be used to train large-scale AI models to study cellular responses and make predictions for cell fate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will be responsible for actively and effectively designing, implementing, and optimizing  wet lab experiments for the self-driving microscope, including cell culture, sample preparation and microscopy imaging. Importantly, you will also actively work with other researchers in the group to develop and optimize protocols for the automated imaging system and AI models. Besides wet lab skills, you will get the opportunity to elaborate on your computational skills, e.g., by writing Python scripts to control the imaging farm, train AI models and develop automated data analysis workflows. In later stages of the project you will also design and conduct additional, custom validation experiments, which may involve different molecular biology techniques.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We would like to take the grand challenge of modeling the human cell and building human cell simulators using powerful AI models. It is an ambitious goal that requires profound innovations in not only data analysis and modeling, but also in data generation. We believe it is crucial for us to build autonomous systems to acquire massive amounts of high quality data that are suitable to train AI models. To this front, we would like to build a fully automated imaging farm which consists of multiple microscopes, robotic arms, liquid handling robots and automatic incubators. Importantly, we run AI models in real-time to augment the microscopy views, generating artificial labels and annotations. It also allows generating feedback signals to or example, control the cell growth, differentiation, and drive the microscope to change field-of-views, illumination power and other experimental conditions in order to optimize the phototoxicity and capture rare events in live cells.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, the long-term goal of the group is to create large-scale whole human cell models trained on existing multi-omics datasets and new data generated by the imaging farm. We envision the human cell models have a great potential in &lt;em>in-silico&lt;/em> cell experimentation, drug discovery and contributing to a holistic and systematic understanding of the human cell.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI4Life - AI Models for BioImaging</title><link>https://aicell.io/project/ai4life/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aicell.io/project/ai4life/</guid><description>&lt;p>AI4LIFE is a Horizon Europe-funded project that brings together the computational and life science communities. Its goal is to empower life science researchers to harness the full potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods for bioimage analysis – and in particular microscopy image analysis, by providing services, and developing standards aimed at both developers and users. With a consortium of ten partners, AI4LIFE promises to create harmonized and interoperable AI tools &amp;amp; methods via Open calls and public challenges and bring these developments to researchers via strategic outreach and advanced training. The services provided and solutions developed within the AI4LIFE framework are crucial to solving today’s microscopy image analysis problems and will contribute to boosting the pace of biological and medical insights and discovery in the coming years.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The AICell Lab at KTH is a leading partner in the AI4Life consortium. We focus on supporting the user services and cloud computing infrastructure via BioImage Model Zoo (&lt;a href="https://bioimage.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bioimage.io&lt;/a>). The model zoo is a community-driven, fully open resource where standardized pre-trained models can be shared, explored, tested, and downloaded for further adaptation or direct deployment in multiple end user-facing tools (e.g., ilastik, deepImageJ, QuPath, StarDist, ImJoy, ZeroCostDL4Mic, CSBDeep). To enable everyone to contribute and consume the Zoo resources, we provide a model standard to enable cross-compatibility, a rich list of example models and practical use-cases, developer tools, documentation, and the accompanying infrastructure for model upload, download and testing. Our contribution aims to lay the groundwork to make deep learning methods for microscopy imaging findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) across software tools and platforms.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this project, we aim to develop web services for providing flexible image data management solutions and also model serving in the cloud (private or public). The BioEngine is being used to support the test run feature in the &lt;a href="https://bioimage.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioImage Model Zoo&lt;/a> website (also see the &lt;a href="https://aicell.io/project/ai4life">AI4Life project&lt;/a>). We aim to provide deployment toolkit for users to setup their own server, either in an institutional Kubernetes cluster or a workstation. Under the AI4Life project, we aim to provide a standard for managing and sharing image data together with the &lt;a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioimage-archive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioImage Archive&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To learn more technial details about the BioEngine, please watch the following video on youtube:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Here is an Open AI codex demo showing how one can generate Python code from English for bioimage analysis including cellpose segmentation, feature extraction and plotting!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Watch the video here:&lt;/p>
&lt;iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pkOp_oUybsc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen>&lt;/iframe>
&lt;p>This type of code generation technology is ideally suited for users without programming skills, and provides a solution for building simple interface for complex scientific software. It enables us to build next generation software that are powerful, flexible, but with only very simple speech or text prompt interface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It can completely change how software tools are delivered to the users. Since the codex model can read developer document and generate code based on the documentation, developers can focus on making reusable library and forget about the GUI part. For each bioimage anlysis task, we can provide a prompt (a chunk of text with hint on how to perform a certain task) and user can then use English or other natural language to send instruction to perform the analysis task. During the code generation, reusable UI components such as jupyter widgets, &lt;a href="https://aicell.io/project/imjoy">ImJoy&lt;/a> plugins or napari can be used to provide rich interaction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./Software-UI-and-Codex.png" alt="Software UI and Codex|690x365" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key difference compared to conventional software design is that the code are generated on the fly, and it effectively makes the user (without programming skills) a developer and makes the software more generalizable for more applications. In addition, the generated software can be reused and published, for example, one can easily generate napari or &lt;a href="https://aicell.io/project/imjoy">ImJoy&lt;/a> plugins with codex model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, as of now, the Codex model remains a black box and we do not have an actual way of controlling the code generation process besides the prompt and instructions. As a result, the generated code are not always correct and safe to run on the user&amp;rsquo;s computer (e.g. it might accidentally remove all the data). Therefore, it is safer to run it in a sandbox environment, e.g. in the browser or docker containers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, &lt;a href="https://aicell.io/project/imjoy">ImJoy&lt;/a> is ideally suited for working with AI generated code because every ImJoy plugin runs in its own sandbox environment and it is easy enough to contain AI generate code that might go wrong seriously. Within the #ImJoy team, we are currently developing a new interface based on Codex code generation. The new interface will be accessible from a web browser and connected to a cloud infrastructure that allows multi-model serving, data management and serverless app hosting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the AICell Lab, we developed the Codex Chat Notebook which aims to use OpenAI Codex to generate python code for image analysis and beyond. The project is currented hosted at: &lt;a href="https://github.com/oeway/codex-chat-notebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/oeway/codex-chat-notebook&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have an OpenAI api token (get it from &lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>), you can already try it out with our Jupyter notebook running in the browser: &lt;a href="https://jupyter.imjoy.io/lab/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://jupyter.imjoy.io/lab/index.html&lt;/a>

However, modeling the entire cell is an extremely complex task and is heavily limited by our understanding of the biological systems. As a newly formed research group, we would like to take the grand challenge of building a human cell simulator through recent advances in multi-omics data generation and artificial intelligence. Our aim is to use recent deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks, transformers, AlphaFold and diffusion models to analysis existing multi-omics dataset, combining them with massive amount of newly generated live cell, multiplexed images, to model cellular behavior through generative and predictive models.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ImJoy - Web Data Analysis</title><link>https://aicell.io/project/imjoy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aicell.io/project/imjoy/</guid><description>&lt;p>Deep learning (DL) methods achieve breakthrough performances in analyzing biomedical data across countless tasks, including medical diagnostics, DNA sequence analysis, augmented microscopy and drug design. Combined with increasing data repositories in genomics, imaging and other fields, such successes underlay a growing demand to adapt DL methods to new datasets and questions1. However, the dissemination of DL approaches faces considerable hurdles. Most published DL studies2,3,4,5 require users to retrain models on their own data to obtain the best performance and/or avoid erroneous results. Although trained models are frequently available through web applications or ImageJ plugins, retraining is typically only possible via scripts or command lines, rather than graphical user interfaces (GUIs). In addition, the complexities of setting up the required hardware and software environments often constitute forbidding obstacles6. Furthermore, the large datasets and computational resources typical of current DL successes pose challenges to traditional desktop-oriented software that tightly couple GUI and computation. Cloud services can partly alleviate these difficulties, but raise privacy and confidentiality issues that can be prohibitive for medical data7. Meanwhile, deploying scientific software to mobile platforms can make them accessible to billions of people8, enabling large-scale biomedical research and citizen science. These opportunities and challenges call for new computational frameworks.&lt;/p>
