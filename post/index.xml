Seeking to build upon its rich legacy, we undertook an ambitious endeavor: to transition ImageJ to the web through &lt;a href="https://ij.imjoy.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ImageJ.JS&lt;/a>. The outcome? An unequivocal triumph. ImageJ.JS has captivated a global audience, attracting over 1,000 users daily. The ability to run ImageJ on mobile devices and iPads has been particularly celebrated, offering users a newfound flexibility and accessibility in their work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-brief-look-back">A Brief Look Back&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The creation of &lt;a href="https://ij.imjoy.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ImageJ.JS&lt;/a> originated from a desire to bring the robust capabilities of the ImageJ image analysis tool directly to web browsers. In the initial stages, we utilized compilers such as &lt;a href="https://leaningtech.com/cheerpj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CheerpJ&lt;/a> to facilitate this transition. This process entailed converting Java Archive (&lt;code>.jar&lt;/code>) files into JavaScript (&lt;code>.jar.js&lt;/code>) files, thereby enabling the execution of Java applications in browsers without necessitating plugins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, despite these efforts, we encountered several hurdles:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>File Size Limitations&lt;/strong>: The web-based environment imposed constraints on loading large datasets, restricting us to files smaller than 4GB.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Lack of Multi-threading Support&lt;/strong>: The absence of multi-threading capabilities limited the performance and speed of computations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Plugin Integration Challenges&lt;/strong>: Incorporating and compiling ImageJ plugins into the web version was a complex task, often requiring extensive adjustments to ensure compatibility.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>To address these issues, we initiated a &lt;a href="https://github.com/imjoy-team/imageja.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fork of the ImageJ project on GitHub&lt;/a>. Here, we explored solutions to bypass the aforementioned constraints and enhance functionality. By delving into the source code, we aimed to optimize ImageJ.JS for smoother and more efficient performance in web environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="elevating-imagejjs">Elevating ImageJ.JS&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Determined to enhance &lt;a href="https://ij.imjoy.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ImageJ.JS&lt;/a>, our team actively sought out cutting-edge solutions that could refine the user experience and expand its capabilities. Recently, &lt;a href="https://labs.leaningtech.com/blog/announcing-cheerpj-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the launch of the updated CheerpJ compiler 3&lt;/a> provided a promising avenue for exploration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This new version of &lt;a href="https://leaningtech.com/cheerpj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CheerpJ&lt;/a> introduced several transformative features. Notably, the new JIT compilation support eliminated the necessity for an intermediate compilation step, which had previously been a cumbersome phase in the deployment process. Instead, the updated CheerpJ allows &lt;code>.jar&lt;/code> files, originally constructed for a standard Java Virtual Machine (JVM), to be loaded directly into the browser. It also support full classloader which makes it easier to dynamically load jar files. This innovation significantly streamlined the process of bringing Java applications into web environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what implications does this have for ImageJ.JS?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Streamlined Plugin Integration&lt;/strong>: The ability to load &lt;code>.jar&lt;/code> files directly paves the way for easier integration with ImageJ&amp;rsquo;s vast plugin ecosystem. Users can now anticipate smoother, more straightforward implementations of plugins, enhancing the versatility of ImageJ.JS.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dynamic Patching Capabilities&lt;/strong>: The updated CheerpJ facilitates dynamic patching, wherein we can swiftly adapt and modify functions to align with web-specific requirements. This provides a seamless transition between traditional desktop applications and web environments, ensuring consistent user experience across platforms.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Upon delving deep into the capabilities of the updated CheerpJ, we were encouraged by the initial results. Enhancements in the speed and efficiency of certain functions were evident, and the newfound ease of integration marked a significant step forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is how the 3D volume viewer looks like in the new ImageJ.JS:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./3d-volume-viewer.gif" alt="3D Volume Viewer" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the 3D surface plot:&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./3d-surface-plot.gif" alt="3D Surface Plot" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without any compilation step, we can for example, directly load the MorpholibJ plugin and run it inside ImageJ.JS:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./morpholibj-filters.gif" alt="MorphoLibJ" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="presentations-and-demos">Presentations and demos!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The kick-off of the hackathon featured a series of introductions and presentations. Wei Ouyang, the leader of the newly founded AICell Lab, presented a compelling overview of his team’s work, including the development of &lt;a href="https://github.com/amun-ai/hypha" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hypha&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://aicell.io/project/bioengine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioEngine&lt;/a> which serves as a robust platform for running AI models in the cloud and &lt;a href="https://forum.image.sc/t/ai-assisted-bioimage-analysis-with-openai-codex/62045" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a large language model-based tool for code generation in image analysis&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

Not to be outdone, the &lt;a href="https://www.apeer.com/app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">APEER&lt;/a> platform revealed its latest feature for training AI models and subsequent local downloads for inference.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-talkathon">The “talkathon”&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Initially, the hackathon resembled a “talkathon”, with participants passionately engaging in dynamic discussions, creating synergy and forming interest groups. These conversations traversed a broad spectrum of topics, ranging from enhancing the usability of client tools, supporting custom pre/postprocessing (like StarDist or Cellpose), and even complex inference modes such as test-time augmentation. The consensus was achieved by proposing an ‘ops’ registry — a GitHub repository that stores dependencies and entry point codes for running custom bioimage analysis operations. In essence, this would create a library of operations that could be linked to each model in the BMZ, with each model potentially having multiple operations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>Originally Posted on &lt;a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/news/new-ddls-fellow-wei-ouyang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciLifeLab website&lt;/a>, on 10th May 2023&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>During 2023, the SciLifeLab &amp;amp; Wallenberg National Program for Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS) continued the recruitment of new fellows. Get to know our latest fellow, Wei Ouyang (KTH), in our Q&amp;amp;A-style article series. Wei will join the Cell and molecular biology research area.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wei began his academic journey in engineering sciences in China before moving to Paris to pursue his PhD in 2014. There, he focused on AI and advanced microscopy imaging. In 2019, he joined Emma Lundberg’s group at SciLifeLab &amp;amp; KTH as a postdoctoral researcher for four years. Before joining DDLS, Wei had the opportunity to spend some months at Stanford University as a visiting scholar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Passionate about developing AI-based computational methods and open-source platforms to democratize AI in life science, Wei is actively involved in consortiums and community activities that promote open, scalable, accessible, and reproducible data-driven life science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He is now thrilled to establish the &lt;a href="https://aicell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AICell Lab&lt;/a> at SciLifeLab, which focuses on building AI-systems for cell and molecular biology. The lab’s ambition is to create a large-scale human cell simulator powered by massive AI models and automated microscopy imaging farms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How do you think your expertise can contribute to the program?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given the current advancements in AI, particularly the significant progress in generative modelling like chatGPT and Diffusion models, I see enormous potential for applying these foundational models to data-driven life sciences in a fully data-driven manner. Translating the successes from natural language processing and computer vision to life sciences requires a deep understanding of the methods, as well as highly interdisciplinary expertise in AI, data science, and biology, among other areas. It demands not only innovation in data analysis but also in data generation. My experience in robotic systems, AI-powered advanced microscopy, image and multi-omics data analysis, data-driven whole-cell modelling, open-source AI tool development, and online data sharing and AI model serving platforms makes me well-suited to contribute to these efforts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to my technical expertise, I strongly believe in the importance of open-source software development and community engagement in scientific research. I have been actively involved in creating and sharing tools that make deep learning more accessible to researchers, as well as promoting open and reproducible scientific tools. My experience in community building and leadership will be invaluable in driving and reforming the data-driven life science program, fostering collaboration, and accelerating progress in this exciting and rapidly evolving field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Shortly describe your research in an easy to understand way.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My research focuses on creating a “black-box” human cell simulator using powerful AI models. This ambitious project involves developing autonomous systems to collect massive amounts of high-quality data for AI training, including building a fully automated imaging farm. By running AI models in real-time, we create a self-driving imaging and cell experimentation system, which allows us to optimize experimental conditions and capture rare cellular events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, our goal is to develop a human cell simulator that unlocks the potential for in-silico cell experimentation, drug discovery, and fosters a holistic understanding of human cells.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How do you think the program and interactions with the other DDLS-Fellows will benefit you?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The DDLS program is a visionary investment in the next generation of life science and offers a fantastic starting package to build a community that pioneers the future of the field. Being a part of this program has given me the incredible opportunity to establish my own research group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interacting with other DDLS-Fellows allows us to help each other, learn, and grow together. The program also serves as a platform for expanding my network of collaborations and learning new skills from experts both within and outside the program. I believe that, in the future, we will see even more coordinated efforts to shape data-driven life sciences through these valuable connections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Name one thing that people generally do not know about you.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Throughout my studies, I developed a fascination for computational philosophy and the view of the universe as a giant computer. The concept of emergent behaviour from the iterative evaluation of simple rules, similar to how cells in biology and large language models in AI function, particularly intrigued me. This has inspired my passion for developing a human cell simulator, as it presents a unique and exciting opportunity to delve into the underlying rules governing cellular behaviour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Where do you see yourself in five years regarding the DDLS aspect?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In five years, I envision myself having established a robust framework for data-driven whole-cell simulation, contributing significantly&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>In one word, describe how you feel about becoming a DDLS-Fellow.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Deep learning has already revolutionized the way we do image analysis, now it comes the latest AI models for natural language processing which will change the way we interact with bioimage analysis software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is an Open AI codex demo showing how one can generate Python code from English for bioimage analysis including cellpose segmentation, feature extraction and plotting!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Watch the video here:&lt;/p>
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pkOp_oUybsc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen>&lt;/iframe>
&lt;p>This type of code generation technology is ideally suited for users without programming skills, and provides a solution for building simple interface for complex scientific software. It enables us to build next generation software that are powerful, flexible, but with only very simple speech or text prompt interface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It can completely change how software tools are delivered to the users. Since the codex model can read developer document and generate code based on the documentation, developers can focus on making reusable library and forget about the GUI part. For each bioimage anlysis task, we can provide a prompt (a chunk of text with hint on how to perform a certain task) and user can then use English or other natural language to send instruction to perform the analysis task. During the code generation, reusable UI components such as jupyter widgets, imjoy plugins or napari can be used to provide rich interaction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key difference compared to conventional software design is that the code are generated on the fly, and it effectively makes the user (without programming skills) a developer and makes the software more generalizable for more applications. In addition, the generated software can be reused and published, for example, one can easily generate napari or ImJoy plugins with codex model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, as of now, the Codex model remains a black box and we do not have an actual way of controlling the code generation process besides the prompt and instructions. As a result, the generated code are not always correct and safe to run on the user&amp;rsquo;s computer (e.g. it might accidentally remove all the data). Therefore, it is safer to run it in a sandbox environment, e.g. in the browser or docker containers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, ImJoy is ideally suited for working with AI generated code because every ImJoy plugin runs in its own sandbox environment and it is easy enough to contain AI generate code that might go wrong seriously. Within the #ImJoy team, we are currently developing a new interface based on Codex code generation. The new interface will be accessible from a web browser and connected to a cloud infrastructure that allows multi-model serving, data management and serverless app hosting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, we are happy to hear your thoughts about this new direction!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
